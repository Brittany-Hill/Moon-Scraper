# MOON SCRAPER 
Current Version: Dev version 0.1

Currently only works with one site and one type of data that can be havested.

# How it works

This application uses Puppeteer to scrape the links from the HTML of a site for easier DMCA take down.

You fill out a small form with the URL the name as it is shown in the URL and choose the weather it scrolls infinitely or by button.

After a bit of loading time as the Puppeteer moves through the website the output goes to a file (Currently: Test.txt).

Currently runs locally.

# Future Plans:
 
* Text File will be able to be downloaded on client side. 

* Hosting and Server 

* Adding more websites to a database where the HTML selections are preloaded instead of hard coded.

* Create a Loading page which will alert you to download the file when the file is ready.
